                                 operating systems and GDP per capita
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The aim of this project is to research the relationship between the spread of
operating systems in different countries and a measure of their wealth (GDP per
capita).

There are very few players in the operating systems market, mostly due to the
complexity of implementing a whole OS from scratch, but also because of
monopolistic practices of big players. This has lead to a market which is
mostly limited to big corporations.

Different OS have different targets, purposes and users. Some are locked to
specific (expensive) hardware and some can run even on lower-end devices.

The question is, is economic wealth a factor which is related to the popularity
of operating systems?

The language of this project is Greek.


Deployment
==========

You can directly view the HTML file in any compatible web browser (a relatively
modern version is required due to the visualizations contained within). You can
also upload the files to any web server which can serve static files.
